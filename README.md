# Medito App

Meditation can positively transform people's lives. We believe no one should have to pay for it. 

We are the [Medito Foundation](https://meditofoundation.org), and we've built the Medito App for people who have never meditated before or want to deepen their meditation practice. 

The app is free, forever: no ads, no spam, no need to sign up or pay. 

Medito App is a flutter project available on Android and iOS maintained by the Medito Foundation and its community.
